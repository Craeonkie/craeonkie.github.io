                            <p>
                                Arachnids are a class of arthropods that include spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites. They are
                                characterized by having eight legs, no antennae, and bodies divided into two main segments: the
                                cephalothorax and abdomen. Unlike insects, arachnids do not have wings or compound eyes. They are
                                predominantly terrestrial and are known for their adaptations to a wide variety of environments,
                                from deserts to forests. Arachnids are thought to have evolved from marine ancestors, likely close
                                relatives of horseshoe crabs, during the Silurian period over 430 million years ago. As they adapted
                                to land, they developed features like book lungs or tracheae for breathing air, and many evolved venom
                                for predation or defense.

                            <p>
                                Crustaceans are a diverse group of primarily aquatic arthropods that include crabs,
                                lobsters, shrimp, barnacles, and copepods. They usually have hard exoskeletons reinforced
                                with calcium, two pairs of antennae, and specialized appendages for swimming, feeding, and walking.
                                Crustaceans are especially dominant in marine environments and are vital parts of aquatic food chains.
                                They likely evolved from a common ancestor shared with insects and myriapods during the Cambrian
                                period, roughly 500 million years ago. Their early evolutionary adaptations allowed them to thrive
                                in water, including the development of gills for underwater respiration and complex larval stages
                                that aid in dispersal and survival.

                            <p>
                                Hexapods, the group that includes insects, are the most numerous and diverse class of arthropods.
                                They are defined by having six legs, three distinct body segments (head, thorax, and abdomen), and
                                often wings. Insects like beetles, butterflies, and ants have colonized nearly every terrestrial
                                habitat on Earth. Hexapods are believed to have originated from a crustacean-like ancestor, which
                                transitioned to land during the Devonian period over 400 million years ago. Their evolution of wings
                                and compact body plans gave them a massive evolutionary advantage, allowing them to explore the air
                                and develop highly specialized ecological roles, from pollinators to decomposers.

                                Myriapods include centipedes and millipedes, and are known for their long, segmented bodies and
                                many legs—millipedes can have hundreds! They are entirely terrestrial and mostly dwell in moist
                                environments, where they feed on decaying plant material (in the case of millipedes) or are active
                                predators (in the case of centipedes). Myriapods are among the earliest arthropods to colonize land,
                                appearing around 420 million years ago. Their ancestors likely diverged from the same lineage as insects
                                and crustaceans, but evolved in isolation as they adapted to the soil and leaf litter environments,
                                developing strong exoskeletons and breathing through spiracles and tracheal systems.

                                        In Greek mythology, Arachne was a mortal weaver whose hubris led her to challenge the goddess Athena. After besting the goddess in a weaving contest, Arachne was transformed into a spider—marking one of the earliest tales connecting humans to arachnids. Her story is both a cautionary tale and a symbolic origin for our modern word “arachnid,” cementing the spider as a figure of skill, pride, and divine punishment in Western mythos.

                                        A giant moth kaiju from the Godzilla franchise, Mothra stands out as both a destructive force and a divine protector. Often portrayed with themes of sacrifice and balance, Mothra has gained a reputation as a symbol of nature’s power, beauty, and wrath—contrasting the typical monstrous depiction of insects in cinema.

Often used to signal humorous 'good riddance' events, it represents a modern, digital age fascination with arthropods—now not feared or revered, but gleefully memed.

Legend tells of Empress Leizu discovering silk while sipping tea beneath a mulberry tree. These arthropods helped shape trade routes and luxury markets through the famous Silk Road.

                                        Fleas—tiny arthropods often overlooked—played a devastating role in history as vectors of the Black Death. Transmitted via infected rats and fleas, the plague reshaped Europe, leading to widespread mortality, economic collapse, and long-term societal changes. Their legacy is a grim reminder of arthropods' capacity to impact civilization.

                                Insects, although less common in Western diets, are widely eaten in parts of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Species like crickets, grasshoppers, and mealworms are rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, and are often roasted, fried, or ground into flour. As sustainable food sources, insects are gaining global attention for their low environmental impact compared to traditional livestock.

Some practicecs put them in jars of alchohol to ferment, and are claimed to have medicinal properties.

                                Due to their water environment, Crustaceans are usually slow and
                                not threathening looking. They are also bigger, making them much
                                easier for humans to eat them. Whereas with many of the other
                                arthropods, they live on land, flying around and crawling very fast with their small bodies,
                                which scares us.<br><br>

                                Many crustaceans are not poisonous, whereas most of the land arthropods commonly are
                                either venomous or poisonous, discouraging us from eating them.<br><br>

                                crabs and prawns and lobsters, resulting in us eating them whole should we try to, their
                                tough outer chitin making them taste bitter. However, many insects, without their shells,
